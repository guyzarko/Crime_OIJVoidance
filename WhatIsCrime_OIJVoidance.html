<h2 align="center"> <b>Crime_OIJVoidance</b></h2> 
   <p><b> Description </b> The City of Chicago has a substantially higher crime rate than the Unites States average. Crime_OIJVoidance is an application that provides a tool to assist in problem-solving and combating crime and disorder in the neighborhoods. Crime_OIJVoidance offers a basic explanation of the different crimes and examples. The main feature allows you to access a choropleth map. The map has shaded or patterned areas based on the latitude and longitude of reported crimes gathered from the City of Chicago's API. The map allows us to focus on high areas of crime, so we can take action to help lower the statistics. Our project utilizes technologies such as Tensorflow, Google map API, Python and Bootstrap that is hosted on a website that Aurora University provided with the IP address for our project.

<p><b> Statistics </b> 
“The City’s South and West Sides (Englewood, Harrison,  and Austin districts) account for  about half of the city’s murders in the year 2016” -CPD

“In 2017, CPD will focus on initiatives that aim to reduce violence, increase the capability of our police officers, and rebuilt public trust” –CPD Eddie Johnson 

53 homicides, 245 shooting incidents with 307 victims in January 2017
</p>


   <p><b> Technologies </b> --GitHub Repository, Command Prompt, Python, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, JS, Google Maps API. </p>
   
   <p><b> Marketability </b> The crime rates in cities seems to be increasing. It is believed that crime is not increasing nor decreasing but social media has made it easier to report and that is why it seems to be increasing.Our group aims to take the City of Chicago’s crime history and analyze it to see which neighborhoods are in fact safe or not. This is a marketable project due to the high demand of understanding crime and taking action to change our neighborhoods.
